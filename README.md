## Hello!

My name is Aden Briano! I am a current Rising Senior at Rice University in Houston, TX, studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

I'm currently working on a 32-bit RISC-V soft processor, as well as a custom MCU-integrated PCB for playing the classic Snake game. At the time this README was last updated (June 2025), I was working at General Dynamics Mission Systems as a Systems Engineering Intern.

I'm currently diving deeper into Verilog and C programming. If you have good resources or want to collaborate on a project, let me know!

Feel free to talk to me about videogames, chess, cubing, travel, or anything you want! You can reach me by email at brianoeaden@gmail.com or message me on my LinkedIn, which can be found on this page. 

Thank you for reading!
